        <h1>My Goals</h1>

        <h2>Academic Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a sophomore at Stanford studying computer science. I hope to one day pursue a PhD in computer science, 
            which can lead to a career where I can impact and improve both my community and the broader society using 
            technical, data-driven research and solutions.

        <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
        As a Hispanic woman finding my place in STEM, having a seat at the table extends far beyond my own interests and ambitions.  
        I feel empowered to inspire others who follow me, to spark discussion and change to help members of my community, 
        and to create new solutions that stem from my background. I hope I can be a role model for other kids from my community.
